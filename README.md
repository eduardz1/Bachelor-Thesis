# Design and Development of the Digital Twin of a Greenhouse

The thesis is written in [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst), a new markup-based typesetting system that is meant to replace LaTeX. To compile you need to have typst installed, the project was compiled with `version 0.9`.

# Background

The thesis was written on the basis of the intership I followed in the reaserch centre at the Uiversity of Oslo's Computer Science department during my semester abroad from the University of Turin. The compiled pdf can be found in the [main.pdf](./main.pdf) file, the presentation in the [presentation.pdf](./presentation.pdf) file.

# Abstract

In this thesis, we will talk about what digital twins are and how they can be used in a range of scenarios, we will introduce some concepts of the Semantic Web that will serve as a basis for our work. We will also introduce a novel programming language, SMOL, developed to facilitate the way to interface with digital twins. We will talk about the work of myself and my colleagues in the process of building the physical twin with a focus on the structure and the way the responsibilities of the different components are modularized. Finally, we will talk about the software components that we wrote as part of this project, including the code to interact with the sensors and the actuators - with a focus on the Python code and the way it's structured - and the SMOL code that serves as a proof of concept for the automation of the greenhouse.
