= Conclusions

By the end of the internship, a working model of the greenhouse was created, the sensors and the Python program enabled it to continuously monitor the parameters we discussed and save the information on a time series database. After the internship, I learned several concepts related to semantic technologies and the semantic web. It was a very interesting experience working with a novel language, SMOL, that was tailor-made for the specific use case. The project allowed me to affine my skills in Python and to have the opportunity to structure a highly modular project. I had to learn some electronics to interface the Raspberry with the sensors and working with them was a learning experience. We hope our work will help in case the team at the University of Oslo decides to scale up the project.
