  #underline[NASA's definition of digital twin]
    
  \"An integrated multiphysics, multiscale, probabilistic simulation of a vehicle or system that uses the best available physical models, sensor updates, fleet history, etc., to mirror the life of its flying twin. It is ultra-realistic and may consider one or more important and interdependent vehicle systems\"@dtnasa

A digital twin is a live replica of a Physical System and is connected to it in real-time, application. Digital Twins are meant to understand and control assets in nature, industry, or society at large, they are meant to adapt as the underlying assets evolve with time. @smol
They are categorized into distinct definitions depending on their level of integration @fmi:

#set par(justify: true, first-line-indent: 0em) // FIXME: workaround for https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/1050
/ Digital Model: acts as a digital copy of an existing model or system, changes in the digital copy do not affect the physical system.

/ Digital Shadow: extends the digital copy by automatic the exchange of data from the physical system to the digital shadow, but not the opposite.

/ Digital Twin: defines the highest level of integration in which the exchange of data is bidirectional with both systems affecting one another.

NASA was one of the first to introduce the concept of digital twins, however, this research field still lacks any form of standardization, NASA's approach is a monolithic one, what we're trying to do with SMOL is provide a more flexible approach and the basis for a standard way to approach this kind of problems.

    == Applications
    Digital Twins are already extensively used in a wide range of fields, ranging from power generation equipment - like large engines, and power generation turbines - to establish timeframes for regularly scheduled maintenance, to the health industry where they can be used to profile patients and help tracking a variety of health indicators. @dtibm

    == FMI

    FMI stands for Functional Mockup Interface, it's a standard created to standardize the model exchange and the co-simulation format in the field of digital twins @fmi. The interface encapsulates simulators in FMUs (Functional Mock-up Units) which are software components that are used for exchanging and simulating dynamic system models. As formalized by Gomes, LÃºcio, and Vangheluwe @cosim, simulation units are a tuple $(S, U, Y, mono("set"), mono("get"), mono("doStep"))$ with $S$ as the domain of internal states, $U$ the set of inputs, $Y$ the set of outputs, $mono("set"): S times U times cal(V) -> S$ the function to set the values of the inputs to some values of domain $cal(V)$, $mono("get"): S times Y -> cal(V)$ the function to get the results and $mono("doStep"): S times RR^+ -> RR$ the function to perform the simulation for a given amount of time @ksosu.

    == Twinning by Construction
    // TODO:
    Digital twins that mirror a structure that does not change over time, also referred to as static digital twins, are said to be _twinned-by-construction_ if the initialization of the digital system ensures the twinning property @tbc.
